## Project Overview

Semipro is a startup focused on helping parents of athletes turn their passion into a profession. They were in the early stages of finding a problem-solution fit and required an engineer (me) to build their MVP. The first MVP was a web app with resources, and they needed a professional-looking UI design and the ability to author content.

## Problem Statement

Semipro required a web developer to build a MVP that would allow parents of athletes to access resources to help their children become professionals. They needed a UI design that would make the app look professional and easy to navigate, and the ability to author content to keep the resources up to date.

## Solution

To ship the MVP quickly, I used Vercel and NextJS to build the UI. This allowed me to develop quickly and keep the site responsive. I used Tailwind for styling, which allowed me to create a professional-looking UI design quickly. To ensure future architecture, I set up an Airbnb style Eslint and Prettier.

For content editing, I used Sanity. This allowed the Semipro team to easily author content and update resources as needed. The tech stack for the project included Typescript, ReactJS, Tailwind, Sanity, and NextJS.

To manage the Agile workflow, I used GitHub Project, which allowed me to track issues, assign tasks, and manage sprints. I used GitHub for version control and collaborating with other developers.

## Next Step

The next step for Semipro is to gather feedback from users through Google Analytics and UX research. This will help them to understand how users are interacting with the site and identify areas where improvements can be made.

## Conclusion

Building the MVP for Semipro was an exciting project. Using modern web technologies like React, NextJS, and Sanity, we were able to create a professional-looking site with the ability to easily author content. With the Agile workflow and collaboration tools, we were able to work efficiently and deliver the project on time. The foundation we laid with this MVP will allow Semipro to iterate and improve their product in the future.
