# Oly Su's portfolio

Hello, world ðŸ‘‹! This is the repo for Oly Su's product designer portfolio. 

Creating portfolios is a massive task for designers. Due to time constraints I've set up my 'MVP' portfolio as GitHub pages for now. You can access the current portfolio and content at [https://olyism.github.io/oly-portfolio](https://olyism.github.io/oly-portfolio).

All the content are currently created with markdown in the [`docs`](https://github.com/olyism/oly-portfolio/tree/main/docs) folder.

The next major release will feature a more usable and aesthetic frontend UI (track the progress on the [project page](https://github.com/olyism/oly-portfolio/projects/1)).

## This is a prototype that uses

- **HTML**
- CSS
  - No [Sass](http://www.sass-lang.org)
  - Just plain CSS
