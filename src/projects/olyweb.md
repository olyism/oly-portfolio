## Introduction

As a senior Product Designer, my client needed a personal website to showcase some of his work examples and display his CV. The website would make it easier for potential clients and employers to understand his abilities and hire him.

## Design and development

To meet my client's objectives, I developed a visually attractive website that was built according to his excellent Figma design file. The website's design and layout were meticulously planned to showcase my client's portfolio and work experience. I worked closely with my client to design the Information Architecture (IA) of the website, ensuring that it best supported the website's business goals.

To optimize the page-switching experience, I incorporated the use of Link/Next. This feature ensures that the website loads quickly, which enhances the user experience. Additionally, I used components for easy content management. As my client's project grows, the website's code can be easily updated for future content.

## Tech Stack

I used a tech stack that included NextJS, ReactJS, and Tailwind, which allowed me to build a highly responsive website that was both fast and efficient. I worked with Figma, the popular design tool, to build the website from the Figma design file. I also worked with SVG files to ensure that the website's visual elements were of the highest quality.

## Project management

To ensure agile delivery, I employed a Jira board for project management. The Jira board allowed me to collaborate with my client, provide progress updates, and address issues efficiently. I also utilized GitHub for version control, which ensured that the website's codebase was secure and easily accessible.

## Conclusion

In summary, I delivered an exceptional personal website that achieved my client's objective of showcasing his work examples and displaying his CV. The website's design, functionality, and codebase were developed with my client's goals in mind, and I'm proud to have delivered a website that truly represents his skills and abilities as a senior Product Designer.
