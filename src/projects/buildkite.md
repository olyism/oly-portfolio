## Overview

I joined Buildkite to be part of a critical mission â€” onboarding and growth. Initially joined as the Senior Product Designer for Docs, my journey with Buildkite saw me metamorphose into various roles. I became the Acting Product Manager to set up the team, transitioned back to a Product Designer role to revamp the onboarding experience, and eventually ventured into growth design to deliver our competitive value proposition and get more sign-ups.

## Role & contribution

- **Design leadership:** Led the product design from inception to completion.
- **Product discovery:** Delve into the problem space to uncover the core business and user challenges, ideate and shaping the solutions
- **UI design:** Used Figma for UI design, transforming ideas into tangible visuals.
- **Development:** Was hands-on with implementing design improvements and building new features using Rails, ReactJS, and Next.js.
- **Collaboration:** Ran design workshops to foster creativity and consensus amongst the team and stakeholders.
- **Research:** Spearheaded customer research to uncover pain points and gather actionable insights.

## Challenge

The duality of challenges faced by Buildkite revolved around both value proposition perception and user experience. Despite being a mature CI/CD product powering world-class tech firms (such as Uber, Tesla, OpenAI etc), our visibility in the market was suboptimal. Furthermore, potential users, particularly DevOps engineers unfamiliar with Buildkite, found the onboarding process daunting due to its sheer breadth and depth, which results in high attrition rates.

## Process

1. **Discovery:** Delved deep into the problem, collaborating with multidisciplinary teams to hone in on both business and user-centric issues.
2. **Ideation:** Adopted a progressive approach to product discovery. This began with outlining low fidelity user flows and fat-marker sketches. Through iterative feedback and collaboration, these were refined and evolved into higher fidelity wireframes.
3. **High-fidelity design:** Transitioned the refined ideas into high-fidelity designs using Figma. Simultaneously, prototypes were developed to gauge functionality and user experience.
4. **Development:** Beyond designing, I was intimately involved in the actual building process. Using Rails, React, and Next.js, I worked closely with the engineering team, ensuring the quality of my contributions and alignment with our code structure and design systems.
5. **Evaluation:** Once launched, we actively monitored the performance of our solutions, continually learning and iterating based on real-world usage.

## Outcomes and impact

- Achieved a significant reduction in the "time to first green build" from hours to mere minutes, enhancing the user's initial experience.
- Conducting the company's most extensive customer interview, I garnered invaluable feedback, especially from those previously unfamiliar with Buildkite. This feedback found its way back into refining our projects.
- An overhaul of the technical documentation site was undertaken, streamlining its information architecture and enhancing its visual appeal.

## What I learned

- Understanding the struggles of new customers was enlightening. It shaped our strategies for growth and improving onboarding.
- Recognizing our product's unique strengths and how they catered to our customers' jobs-to-be-done allowed us to integrate these insights more effectively into our workflow.
- Lastly, the journey underscored the importance of collaborative teamwork. By ensuring progressive information disclosure, we could keep all stakeholders aligned, solicit specific feedback, and steer our decision-making forward.
