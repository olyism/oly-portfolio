## Overview

I had the privilege of playing an instrumental role in one of the largest government website overhauls: the StatsNZ re-design and re-platform. Our challenge was not just technical, but cultural and operational. The aim was to transition from traditional content delivery to a dynamic web app experience on the Common Web Platform (CWP) – New Zealand’s official web framework. The horizon was promising: a revamped platform for the public to seamlessly engage with government statistics and the eventual establishment of a SwaggerAPI for third-party integration.

## Role & duration

- *Position:* Full-stack Developer specializing in ReactJS and PHP.
- *Engagement duration:* A fulfilling and intense 10-month period.

## Objective

The ambition of StatsNZ was multi-dimensional:

1. Pioneering a shift from mundane spreadsheet data delivery to an immersive web app experience.
Skillfully navigating their intricate information architecture, laden with a spectrum of data ready for visualization.
2. Onboarding their design team to the world of responsive design with a “mobile-first” mantra at its heart.
3. Bridging the knowledge gap for their in-house engineers who were on the cusp of acquainting themselves with our modern tech stack and the Agile methodology.

## My contributions

- SilverStripe PHP Framework & CMS:
  - Leveraged the PHP framework’s MVC paradigm to seamlessly cater to StatsNZ’s intricate requirements.
  - Built CMS features to enable StatsNZ's editorial team to have granular control over a multifaceted information ecosystem, all while effortlessly managing content publication schedules.
- ReactJS development:
  - Built a visually engaging and interactive user interface.
  - Explore the idea headless CMS (which was new during the time), aligning it with SilverStripe’s capabilities.
  - Integrated Redux for state management.
  - Built a foundational design system for the client's design and dev team.
- Coaching StatsNZ:
  - Ran Agile ceremonies with the client to help them adopt the new way of working
  - Introduced GitLab for streamlined git collaboration.
  - Advocated for responsive design, emphasizing mobile-centricity and design pattern thinking.

## Outcomes and impact

- Within the very first month, our team had put forth a tech and design proof-of-concept, cementing the viability of our chosen tech stack and setting the stage for a revitalized user experience.
- Despite the shifting sands of client requirements and numerous directional pivots, our team stayed resilient, delivering all foundational features.
- A seamless handover to the client's development ensemble was achieved. This included comprehensive documentation covering our operational blueprints, tech insights, and a tangible demonstration of Agile's efficacy.
- The re-imagined user experience received an overwhelmingly positive reception, reinforcing our endeavors.

## What I learned

- This project marked my inaugural deep dive into ReactJS – and set me up to build component UIs and explore other frameworks in the future (such as Vue.js)
- Experimenting with a headless CMS within the SilverStripe community was pioneering. Though our implementation had its share of challenges, it was a great experiment and inspired future opportunities.
- A takeaway for the future: Collaborative crafting of the information architecture with the client would have optimized our engineering focus, preventing deviations based on assumptions.
