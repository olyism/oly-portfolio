## Background

Chuckroo is a blogging platform for tech professionals to share, comment, and discuss ideas. The platform was developed by a cross-functional team of 8 developers, 2 BAs, and 1 UI designer, with an Agile project management approach. The team used GitHub for version control and collaboration with developers. The completed user journey includes sign-up, login, read blogs, write blogs, make tags, publish blogs, and sign-out.

## Solution and features

The team used NextJS for server-side rendering (SSR) and Vercel for quick deployment. We implemented Airbnb style Eslint and prettier to streamline the code style and NextAuth for secure authentication. Additionally, the team wrote their own CMS with Supabase and Prisma, and their own database. We used components to ensure the code was readable, maintainable, and reusable, and implemented CRUD data management. Finally, the team added responsive features to ensure a great experience across different screen sizes.

## Tech stacks

The team used Typescript and React for the frontend, and NextJS and Prisma for the backend.

## My main Contribution

As a developer on the Chuckroo project, my main contribution was to create components to ensure the code was DRY and easy for other developers to use. I also built page layouts to ensure the layout was consistent across pages and screen sizes, and built features according to the design specs. Additionally, I designed the database structure based on the business logic, participated in code reviews to learn and share knowledge, and helped the team with bug fixing to ensure the code quality and move the project forward.

## Project management

The team used Shortcut for Agile delivery and sprint planning, and held weekly stand-ups to discuss progress and any blockers.

## Next steps

The team plans to implement in-line commenting to enable users to do quick interaction with the content.

## Conclusion

Chuckroo is a robust and scalable blogging platform developed by a cross-functional team using the latest technologies and Agile project management approach. By creating reusable components, designing a flexible database structure, and focusing on code quality, the team was able to build a platform that offers a great user experience and meets the needs of tech professionals. With in-line commenting as the next step, the platform is poised for further growth and success in the future.
