## Overview

At the brink of a fiercely competitive landscape, I was invited onboard Qantas Holidays' green-field project as a Senior Product Designer. Working alongside the Product Manager, we strived to breathe life into the vision and strategy, complemented by technology and business operations. Balancing design with technical constraints, we forged a user experience that seamlessly integrates flights, hotel availability, account management, and bookings.

## Role & contribution

- UI design for the new Qantas Holidays brand to match the groups excellence and customers' premium expectations
- Delved deep into customer research, managing everything from recruiting interviewees to conducting usability tests and synthesis
- Crafted prototypes, facilitating both user testing and the technical feasibility examination by engineers.
- Pilot and migrate design teams to Figma

## Challenge

While Qantas's Hotel product registered bookings, it primarily attracted short 1–2 night stays. The company's vision was to venture into the luxury leisure holiday market, aiming to increase the average booking value. On the user front, the primary goal was to offer Qantas customers the best value — a sweet spot between price, quality, and convenience, with Qantas Points redemption being a crucial value proposition.

## Process

- Beginning with a core team of three – a Product Manager, Tech Lead, and myself, we initiated a 'Concierge MVP' approach: 
  - I designed a Holiday Package landing page linked to a Google Form for booking callbacks.
  - Simultaneously, the tech lead developed a rudimentary booking system, and the PM facilitated a call center for bookings.
- As the engineering team grew, we introduced enhanced features. I collaborated closely with the engineers to prioritize a user-friendly payment and checkout system, especially catering to the complex points redemption.
- Unexpectedly, COVID-19 struck. During a hiatus from design, I took on customer support roles for three months.
- Upon returning, our attention turned to the flight option interface – a confluence of intricate use-cases from hotel bookings to flight timings. My partnership with the tech lead and engineers ensured a user-friendly UI creation.
- After rigorous customer research, usability testing and refining the build, the official Qantas Holidays brand was unveiled, and unexpectedly grew exponentially through promoting interstate travels amidst the pandemic.
- As a part of the design team's restructuring, I spearheaded our transition from Sketch to Figma, enhancing collaboration across cities and remote teams.

## Outcomes and impact

- Achieved a user-friendly UI design, confirmed through meticulous MVP and usability tests.
- Despite the pandemic's challenges, Qantas Holidays asserted its value, capitalizing on interstate travel and positioning itself favorably against competitors impacted by the pandemic.
- With my efforts and passion for Figma, the Qantas teams seamlessly transitioned to Figma, receiving commendable support from designers, engineers, and PMs.

## What I learned

- Iterative Design: Despite occasional skepticism, I learned to trust the process and cut through the noise. Our results vindicated our approach.
- Empathy at work: COVID-19 accentuated the importance of team well-being. It inspired a renewed commitment to understanding and addressing the emotions and requirements of those I work with.
