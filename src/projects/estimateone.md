## Overview

EstimateOne is a specialized SaaS product for to the construction industry, focusing primarily on the pre-construction phase. With its primary clientele being Builders, Subcontractors, and Suppliers, it aims to streamline and optimize more construction processes.

## Role & contribution

During my tenure at EstimateOne, I embarked on a transformative journey, working with the company to shift towards product methodologies. Rotating across three pivotal product teams - Builders, Subcontractors, and Suppliers - I was deeply involved with the Supplier product, which required intensive research and a complete redesign, as well as working with the engineering team to transition from jQuery + Symphony to a ReactJS frontend.

- Provided UI design support across all three products, ensuring a seamless user experience.
- Conducted extensive customer research and interviews to derive insights and understanding of user pain points.
- Contributing both in terms of design and code to transition the Supplier Product from jQuery to ReactJS

## Challenge

The primary challenge for EstimateOne was the necessity for design resources to support and enhance the product's features. The Supplier Product posed a significant challenge due to its nascent stage, requiring extensive discovery. Despite having a plethora of data, making it meaningful for suppliers was pivotal. The distinct user dynamics added another layer to the challenge - while builders aimed to maximize quotes from subcontractors, subcontractors sought reliable builders, and suppliers aspired to expand their network and promote their products to architects for integration into construction specs.

## Process

I collaborated closely with the product leads to better understand the intricate business dynamics between our users. Here's a snapshot of my process:

- **Discovery:** Whiteboarding initial artefacts, such as user flows and wireframe sketches, was instrumental in highlighting insights and proposing design directions.
- **Design iterations:** From low-fidelity wireframes to high-fidelity designs, my designs evolved based on feedback from product leads, engineers, and the support team.
- **Prototyping and user testing:** We brought designs to life with prototypes, which underwent rigorous usability tests with product leads, engineers, and occasionally, with our end-users.
- **Implementation:** With the Supplier product, my designs weren't just limited to visuals â€“ I collaborated with engineers to mold them into ReactJS components.
- **Evaluation:** We monitored our released experiments with A/B testing tools and screen recording to understand user behavior and areas of improvement.

## Outcomes and impact

- Successfully evolved the Supplier product's business model by deriving insights from customer interviews.
- Seamlessly migrated the Supplier product from jQuery to ReactJS.
- Designed a future-state, high-fidelity prototype for the Supplier product to guide the roadmap for further discovery
- Designed a new tender portal for subcontractors, eliminating the need for user sign-ups and enabling builders to invite more companies for quotes.

## What I learned

- **Understanding dynamics:** I realized the importance of comprehending the interplay between user types to benefit both the user and the business, and how a misstep could easily offset our gains.
- **Strategic design:** Recognizing the appropriate level of detail in designs became instrumental in providing clarity and aligning the team's vision.

In essence, my journey with EstimateOne reinforced my belief that user-centric designs, aligned with business goals and immersive understanding of the ecosystem, lay the foundation for product success.
