## Overview

I was brought on board as a Senior Innovation Specialist to bolster the design team's delivery capabilities. My expertise in product design and software engineering was vital in crafting the Return To Work Planner. This custom-built Vue.js web app, backed by AWS for simple authentication and email notifications, served dual functions. Not only did I create the customer-facing side, but also the backend portal for inspectorates, facilitating seamless tracking of return-to-work activities.

## Role & contribution

- Oversaw the UI design of the Return to Work Planner.
- Constructed both the customer interface and backend office Vue.js applications.
- Enhanced WorkSafe's operational methods through innovative strategies.

## Challenge

- User Concern: Employers are often left in the dark when faced with an injured worker. Yet research has indicated that early employer-employee communication can hasten recovery times and elevate worker well-being.

- Organizational Concern: Soaring WorkCover premiums could render the service unaffordable in a decade. Prolonged absences due to injury not only raise secondary injury risks, such as psychological damage, but also increase the likelihood of some workers permanently exiting the workforce.

## Process

- **Orientation:** Jumping into the project post-MVP, I began by immersing myself in every detail. Conversations with in-house experts and a deep dive into usability testing archives were paramount.
- **Collaboration:** While I liaised with the UI designer to integrate user insights, I also played the role of a mentor to refine the designs. Collaborative sessions with the engineering team helped me comprehend the unique tech landscape.
- **Optimization:** Identified a major bottleneck: the time-consuming process of data filtering and uploading to AWS. By scripting a solution, we shaved off hours from the process, bringing it down from 3 hours to a mere 3 seconds.
- **Upskill:** Despite being new to Vue.js, I quickly adapted, mastering its features and the accompanying ecosystem, ensuring I could maintain and upgrade the codebase.
- **Analytics integration:** By integrating Matomo, we brought data-driven insights to the table, enabling us to evaluate and refine our strategies continuously.
- **Feedback and iteration:** Ownership of the back office app was coupled with consistent feedback from the Inspectorate, ensuring constant UX improvements.
- **Showcasing:** Our year-end presentation mirrored a startup pitch, showcasing our achievements, lessons, and future aspirations to the executive team.

## Outcomes and impact

- **Digital Success:** The Return to Work Plannerâ€™s email campaigns recorded a whopping 60% open rate and a 33% click-through rate, translating into actionable guidance for hundreds of employers.
- **Executive validation:** The CEO and executive team's enthusiastic reception of our presentation bolstered our confidence, indicating the limitless possibilities innovation can bring to WorkSafe.

## What I learned

- **Subject matter expert matters:** The insights from subject matter experts can unearth golden opportunities and overlooked pain points.
- **Pitching:** The team have gone through a long journey to research, design, build, measure and iterate, we worked together to condense all the content into a compelling four minute pitch deck
- **Vue.js and related tech:** The hands-on experience with Vue.js not only honed my skills but also deepened my appreciation for its developer-friendly features, especially in contrast with platforms like React.
